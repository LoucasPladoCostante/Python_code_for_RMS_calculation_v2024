# Turbulence-induced vibration in annular flow of a rigid cylinder mounted on a cantilever beam
Code calculating the RMS of the displacement of a rigid cylinder mounted on a cantilever beam under a turbulent fluid flow

This code is related to (maybe) a paper that one can find here: [Since the paper is not published, the reference can't be set, but feel free to contact me if you are interested in this topics or if you have any kind of issues]
